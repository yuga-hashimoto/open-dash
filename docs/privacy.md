# Privacy & data flow

OpenSmartSpeaker is built as a **smart speaker that happens to be
local-first**, not a client for someone else's cloud. This page
enumerates exactly which data crosses the device boundary, where it
goes, and how to turn each channel off.

If a capability is not on this page, it does not leave the tablet.

## What stays on device (always)

- **Voice**: raw microphone audio never leaves the tablet. STT runs
  through Android `SpeechRecognizer` (on-device on all shipped SKUs)
  or the experimental offline Whisper provider when that lands. The
  LLM reply the user hears is TTS'd locally via Android TTS
  (Piper-cpp planned for Phase 16).
- **Conversation history**: stored in in-memory `ConversationHistoryManager`
  during a session. Not persisted to disk. Not uploaded.
- **Memory entries** (`remember`/`recall` tools): Room DB on the
  tablet, never synced. Clearable via Settings → Memory → Clear all.
- **Skill and routine definitions**: asset files (bundled) or internal
  storage (user-installed). No telemetry on which skills fired.
- **Tool usage analytics**: persisted locally in a Room table; purely
  for the Settings → Analytics dashboard. Not uploaded.
- **Device state** (HA / SwitchBot / MQTT): fetched from the user's
  own hub. We never forward it anywhere.

## What can leave the device (opt-in + user-targeted)

Every channel below is either off by default or goes only to a
destination the user configured. We never ship credentials to the
app's developers.

| Channel              | What goes out                                         | Destination                            | How to disable                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Weather              | Lat/lon (from a city name geocode) or the city name. | `open-meteo.com` (no API key)          | Don't set `DEFAULT_LOCATION`; skip the card.  |
| News                 | RSS feed URL only (no user identity).                | User-chosen feed URL (default: NHK).   | Clear `NEWS_FEED_URL` preference.             |
| Web search           | Raw query string.                                     | DuckDuckGo (no API key, no account).   | Don't invoke `web_search` tool.               |
| Home Assistant       | All HA control traffic.                               | The user's own HA instance.            | Clear `HA_URL`.                               |
| SwitchBot            | All SwitchBot control traffic.                        | SwitchBot's servers (user's account).  | Clear `SWITCHBOT_TOKEN`.                      |
| Matter / MQTT        | Local-network device control.                         | Local network only.                    | Clear `MQTT_BROKER`.                          |
| OpenAI-compatible LLM| User prompt + reply.                                  | URL the user configured.               | Switch `AssistantProvider` to `EmbeddedLlm`.  |
| OpenClaw provider    | User prompt + reply.                                  | The user's OpenClaw instance.          | Switch `AssistantProvider`.                   |
| HermesAgent          | User prompt + reply.                                  | The user's Hermes endpoint.            | Switch `AssistantProvider`.                   |
| Multi-room broadcast | NDJSON/WebSocket envelopes signed with HMAC.          | Other speakers on the same LAN only.   | Turn off `MULTIROOM_BROADCAST_ENABLED`.       |
| Model downloads      | LiteRT model URL (one-off).                           | The URL the user pasted.               | Pre-load the model manually and skip the downloader. |

## What we never do

- **No usage telemetry** to our servers. There is no "our servers".
- **No crash reporting** uploaded anywhere. Timber logs are in-process only.
- **No advertising SDKs.** The app has zero ads-related dependencies.
- **No cloud sync for memory, routines, or skills.** Multi-device
  syncing would need an explicit external backend the user stands up
  themselves (tracked on the Phase 17 backlog as "ovos-personal-backend
  port" — not shipped).
- **No access to SMS / contacts / call logs / photos unless the user
  explicitly asks.** Those tools require runtime permissions and are
  only called when the LLM or a fast-path matcher decides they match
  the user's utterance.

## Secret storage

Per-connector credentials are stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`
(Android Keystore-backed). The audited keys are:

- `HA_TOKEN`
- `SWITCHBOT_TOKEN`, `SWITCHBOT_SECRET`
- `MQTT_PASSWORD`
- `OPENCLAW_API_KEY`
- `HERMES_AGENT_TOKEN`
- `MULTIROOM_SECRET` (HMAC shared secret)

Plaintext DataStore holds only non-sensitive settings (locale, wake
word text, UI toggles). If you find a secret in plain DataStore,
file a security issue — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Network-permitted domains (first-party defaults)

If you want to firewall the tablet to the absolute minimum set of
hosts, these are the defaults we reach by design:

- `open-meteo.com` (weather + geocoding)
- `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com`
- `duckduckgo.com` / `html.duckduckgo.com` (web search)
- `www3.nhk.or.jp` / `feeds.bbci.co.uk` / `news.ycombinator.com` (news)
- Whatever HA / SwitchBot / MQTT / OpenClaw / Hermes / model-download URL
  the user configures.

Everything else is user-added.

## How to verify for yourself

1. Settings → Analytics — the only network-heavy tools are
   `get_weather`, `get_forecast`, `web_search`, `get_news`. Their
   destinations are documented above.
2. `adb shell dumpsys netstats` on the tablet while the app is idle —
   expect near-zero traffic outside of the HA/SwitchBot poll interval.
3. `./gradlew lintDebug` — lint runs with a baseline and fails on new
   cleartext-network violations.
4. Source scan: every `HttpUrl` / `Retrofit` instance in the codebase
   lives under a provider wrapper whose job is documented above.

## Open issues

- Phase 16 offline STT/TTS (Whisper / Piper) removes the last
  dependency on Android's on-device speech stack, which is currently
  on-device on all shipped SKUs but not contractually guaranteed by
  Google.
- Phase 17 multi-room pairing word-phrase is in; a full
  challenge-response handshake is tracked on the ADR backlog.
- Model downloads currently trust the URL the user pasted. A future
  PR will bind download hashes into a build-time manifest.
