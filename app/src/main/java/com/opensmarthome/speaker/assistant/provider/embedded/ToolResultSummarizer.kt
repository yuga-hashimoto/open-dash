/**
 * Collapses a tool's raw JSON [ToolCallResult.result] into a compact,
 * plain-text grounding block the on-device LLM can reliably consume in the
 * second round of the agent loop.
 *
 * Why: Gemma-class models (2B / 2-4B params) regularly emit the bare
 * "..." failure mode when fed the raw JSON from `web_search` /
 * `get_weather` / `get_forecast` / `get_news`. The verbose payloads push
 * them past the short context window, confuse their attention, or trigger
 * the "continuation" token loop. Short, structured text ("Abstract: …",
 * "Current: …", "Headlines: …") lets the same model produce a natural
 * 1-2 sentence answer without any prompt-engineering voodoo.
 *
 * The summaries re-use the battle-tested [FastPathResultFormatter.buildPolishSummary]
 * extractors so the same grounding keeps working in two places:
 *   1. fast-path LLM polish round ([FastPathLlmPolisher])
 *   2. agent-loop second round (this class)
 *
 * Everything else (timers, device control, skills …) passes through the
 * raw result because it's already compact and usually not text the LLM
 * is expected to re-summarize for the user.
